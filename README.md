# Pyro Models

Models generated by a custom [stan2pyro transpiler](https://github.com/jpchen/pyro-stan-compiler).  Models are from the [Stan examples](https://github.com/stan-dev/example-models).

The data corresponding to each model is in JSON format and named `[model_file].py.json`.

Tested on PyTorch 1.0 and Pyro 0.3.
