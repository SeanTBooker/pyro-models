# Pyro Models

Models generated by a custom [stan2pyro transpiler](https://github.com/jpchen/pyro-stan-compiler) then manually modified for Pyro 0.3 compatibility manually.  Models are from the [Stan examples](https://github.com/stan-dev/example-models).

The data corresponding to each model is in JSON format and named `[model_file].py.json`.  See `test_models.py` to see an example of how to run a model.

Tested on PyTorch 1.0 and Pyro 0.3.

### Note
Initialized variables are uniformly sampled within their domains.
```diff
- real<lower=0,upper=100> sigma;
+ sigma = pyro.sample("sigma", dist.Uniform(0., 100.))
```

Constrained samples from improper distribution are sampled from a HalfCauchy:
```diff
- real<lower=0> sigma;
+ sigma_a1 =  pyro.sample("sigma", dist.HalfCauchy(2.))
```

For inference to work, you may have to change the initializations of the model parameters.
